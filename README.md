# Devlog Entry - 11/15/2024



## Introducing the team
Tools Lead (Jayden Chung): This person will research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up on their own machine in the best configuration for your project. 
Format Lead (Ali Taquie): Establish team’s coding style guidelines and help peers setup auto-formatting systems. Provide support for systems like source control and automated deployment.
Engine Lead (Vincent Fu): This person will research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it if it is new to them. This might involve making small code examples outside of the main game project to teach others. 
Assistant Engine Lead (Jacky Ho): The Engine Lead should also establish standards for which kinds of code should be organized into which folders of the project. They should try to propose software designs that insulate the rest of the team from many details of the underlying engine.
Design Lead (Antonio Pereda): This person will be responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game. They might make small art or code samples for others to help them contribute and maintain game content. Where the project might involve a domain-specific language, the Design Lead (who is still an engineer in this class) will lead the discussion as to what primitive elements the language needs to provide.



## Tools and materials
We plan to use Unity, Phaser, C#, JavaScript, and VS Code. We chose Phaser because everyone on the team has prior experience with this library/engine. Unity was selected as the other engine because it is widely used in the game industry, making it an interesting tool to learn and develop with. By default, Unity uses C# as its scripting language, while Phaser uses JavaScript. This is advantageous since the two languages have similar syntax, making it easier to switch between them.
We plan to develop our game using either Phaser.js or Unity. Because of the selected frameworks, we would most likely be programming in either Vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, or C#. As we will most likely be implementing a JavaScript based language, we will most likely use JSON as our data language because of its native compatibility with JavaScript. We chose JavaScript and C# because our team has prior experience and familiarity with it. 
The main frameworks/tools we plan to use for authoring our game are Unity and VScode. Everyone on our team is familiar with VScode and we can continue using vscode when switching our game to Phaser. We plan to use most of Unity’s built-in animation and asset store to handle visuals. For visuals in Phaser, I have experience with aesperite to create 2d sprites and setting tweens for animations.  
While we are leaning towards starting with Unity, we all agreed to use Phaser.js as our alternative engine and language. This is because not everyone has experience with Unity, so while working as a good start to learning the engine, everyone has experience and is knowledgeable with Phaser.js. That way if a switch is necessary it will take less time to do Unity->Phaser than Phaser->Unity.


## Outlook
Give us a short section on your outlook on the project. You might cover one or more of these topics:
1) What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
  - Everyone is hoping to be able to make a unique game while fitting the design specs of the project. The goal and idea is to be able to stand out to some degree (art, quality, code, etc) and make something we can be proud of.
2) What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
  - It is anticipated that the most difficult part of the project would be interconnecting our programs where certain code causes interference with other programs. For instance, one code function may cause errors that will break our game. As a team, it’s important to address any issues that may occur so that we can effectively develop our final product. 
3) What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above? 
  - Our team is filled with people with varying backgrounds and experience with game development, especially as a team. We are hoping to be able to work together as a unit to accomplish a goal and make sure to uplift each other as needed. By working together, we ultimately want to gain collaborative knowledge and experience that can translate well into the game development industry.
